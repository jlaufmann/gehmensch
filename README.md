I'm working on a python program / scripts to interface with my sony walkman
because I don't use windows.
It will enable mp3 file property editing as well as automatic playlist
file compilation.
Potentially more.
=======================================================
mediamensch.py - audio file property editing
playmensch.py - making playlist files from a folder containg audio files
transmensch.py - transfer/delete files/playlists/folders from/to the sony walkman
gehmensch.py - to interface with my sony walkman?
